Reminded of my favourite line from a user manual ever. A few years back my Dad bought a ZX Spectrum off ebay that reminded him of one he owned and it still had the manual:

" in your impatience you will probably already have started pressing the keys on the keyboard, and discovered that this removes the copyright message. **This is good; you cannot harm the computer in this way. Be bold. Experiment.** If you get stuck, remember that you can always reset the computer”
