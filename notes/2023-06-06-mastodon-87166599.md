I'm like absolutely sure the Vision Pro isn't worth it, but I'm probably going to by it because I remember when the unibody Macbook came out, the iphone, the ipad and I couldn't afford them at launch and now I am in a position to buy a stupid first gen product from apple my inner child really wants me to buy one.
