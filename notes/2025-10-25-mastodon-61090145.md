I think one of the main things thats making setting up a music library compared to back in 2007ish is that I dont have a “home computer" ive got a mish mash of a macbook, an ipad and a homeserver. And trying to set up my music library so it can be synced to my iPod but also accessed from those devices in my home is just a faff.
