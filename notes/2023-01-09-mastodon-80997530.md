1: The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R. Tolkien (1954)

I have tried to read this a few times in my life. Absolutely love the Movies and have usually found the original book a slog. This time I made it through it and yes it was really good but my main thought throughout it is "Wow Fran Walsh, Phillipa Boynes and Peter Jackson adapted this really fucking well".

Will eventually finish the series, but am desperate for almost anything else after finishing.
