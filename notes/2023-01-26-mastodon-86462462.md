**5: Children of Time** by Adrian Tchaikovsky
This is just a pretty fun sci-fi romp. There are two parts to the story, a human part and a not so human part. The human part hits a lot of the beats of long term space-faring-cryo-sleep-bottle-ship romps of the genre.

But the non human part. Oh that's great. I never thought I'd well up emotionally when a spider astronaut took their first space walk. Or so interested in how spiders would encode visual information in a data stream.
