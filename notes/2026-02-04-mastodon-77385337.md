I think one of the cool things LLMS/Local coding agents could do is really open up fediverse stuff for regular folks.

Fedi and self hosting is just far out of reach for most people, but lowering that barrier to entry would be awesome.

Really it'd be the point where you could have a competent coding agent running in a device that costs, say, less than £1000.
