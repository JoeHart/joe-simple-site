Using a Mac mini for a home server has been nothing but pain.

Trying to get SMB share to mount permanently is almost impossible.

NFS creates a whole bunch of problems with temporary locking files.

Plus macOS dropping dot files everywhere.

I shoulda just gotta a little mini pc and put Linux on it.
