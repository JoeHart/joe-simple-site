2: **Can’t We Just Print More Money?** by The Bank Of England

I commend the authors goals in trying to make economics more accessible but they've ended up with a strange mix of too much explanation and too little in different cases.

60% of the book is an over the top explanation of GCSE level Supply/Demand and then the final few chapters are a too brief explanation of QE, central banks etc. I fear this really will just take people to the first peak of the Dunning–Kruger Graph.
