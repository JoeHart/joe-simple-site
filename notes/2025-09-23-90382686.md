Re-reading a bunch of Asimov stuff and I am just enchanted by the 90s ere cover art. Especially Chris Moore.

![Futuristic painting by Chris Moore of a humanoid robot with smooth, metallic skin. The robot is bald, with rounded ear-like structures on its head, glowing red eyes, and small panel-like markings on its chest and forehead. It holds a metal bar with both hands against a glowing gradient background of deep blue and magenta light.](/img/notes/e734a85b8519.png)
