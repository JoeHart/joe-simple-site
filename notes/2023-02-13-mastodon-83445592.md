Does anyone have like a really cool way of managing bookmarks?

An extension somewhat that links directly into browser, syncs between mobile and desktop. Is incredibly fast?

I've been trying to just use folders in my browser and i'm getting to the limit of what they can do. Equally all the notion/onenote/evernot/clipping extensions are all painfully slow.
