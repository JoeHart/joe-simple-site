I may be totally wrong about this but my bet on AI is humans will rapidly be able to notice "AI generated content" after awhile and will cease to be compelled by it.

![Excerpt of an article with the text:

Asimov's received around 900 stories for consideration in January and is on track to get 1,000 this month. Williams says nearly all of the increase can be attributed to pieces that appear to be AI-generated, and she's read so many that she can now often tell from the first few words whether something might not be written by a human.](/img/notes/062961195d45.png)
