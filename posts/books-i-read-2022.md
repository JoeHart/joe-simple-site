Through the combined powers of **Audible** and **"buying physical books so I can't forget I have them"** I managed to make a larger dent in reading in 2022 than many years previous. This is a loosely categorised and entirely unordered list of what I read with some thoughts attached to them.

The thoughts aren't reviews, more reflections, or _vibes_ I guess.
