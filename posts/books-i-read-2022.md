Through the combined powers of **Audible** and **"buying physical books so I can't forget I have them"** I managed to make a larger dent in reading in 2022 than many years previous. ThiüöÄs is a loosely categorised and entirely unordered list of what I read with some thoughts attached to them.

The thoughts aren't reviews, more reflections, or _vibes_ I guess.

I've loosely organised them into some categories, some of which belong in a few categories but this grouping reflects how I often think about my reading.

## üöÄ Sci-fi Fantasy
Sci-fi is my bread and butter when it comes to reading, I think literature can do great sci-fi better than any other medium out there which is why I keep finding myself being drawn to the genre.

After reading a whole bunch of [Asimov](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16667.Isaac_Asimov) and [Dan Simmons](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2687.Dan_Simmons?from_search=true&from_srp=true) in 2021 I wanted to branch out to sci-fi from other places than just "western bloke". And wow did it pay off in what I picked up this year.

### Xenogenesis Trilogy (1987) _by Octavia Butler_

<img class="book-left" src="/img/dawn.jpg">

What if when humanity was actively wiping itself out with nuclear weapons an alien race was passing by and tried to save humanity?

Like an endangered species the Oankali take humans from their natural habitat and attempt to domesticate and improve them by their own standards.

The best trilogy I've read in a long time and the freshest sci-fi I have read in a very long time. It feels like it could have been written yesterday, there's just so much humanity poured into such a slim volume. Butler explores imperialism, consent, agency and fundamentally human nature.

Even if you aren't into sci-fi the first book, Dawn, is a book I'd recommend to anyone. It would have been my book of the year if I hadn't read [Piranesi](#favourite-book-of-the-year).

### Parable of the Sower (1993) _by Octavia Butler_

This was recommended to me by a friend whose book club recently read it, and coming hot off the heels of Butler's Lillith's Brood trilogy I was more than on board to read it.

A significantly more grounded sci-fi tale than the Xenogenesis trilogy, it again feels like it could have been written today.


### Remembrance of Earth's Past Trilogy (2014) _by Cixin Liu_
![Book covers of The Three-body Problem, The Dark Forest and Death's End](/img/remembrancetrilogy.jpg)

It's capital "H" Hard Sci-fi, but so good. Such a wonderful read, try to know as little as possible going in for the best experience. Devoured it in two days and immediately ordered the other two in the trilogy.

I know a lot of people though who couldn't stand it, so your mileage may vary.

Like a lot of trilogies, it gets flabbier and generally less compelling as the series continues.

There are some really weird tangents about masculinity in the second book that come out of nowhere. This is indeed "China's Foundation Trilogy" in terms of both the scope of the series and also the underwritten women in the books.

### The Long Way To A Small Angry Planet (2014) _by Becky Chambers_

### The Algebraist (2004) _by Iain M Banks_

## üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà Queer Fiction

### The Henna Wars (2020) _by Adiba Jaigirdar_
This was just very wholesome, two girls set up rival Henna businesses and fall in love. Solid, heart warming, ya romance.

### She Who Became The Sun (2021) _by Shelley Parker-Chan_

### Under the Udala Trees _by Chinelo Okparanta_

### The Greatest Thing (2022) _by Sarah Winifred Searle_
Whenever I'm browsing through the monthly comics/graphic novel previews on [Forbidden Planet](https://forbiddenplanet.com/) I'll see a book with a cover and a vague description where it doesn't explicitly *say* it's a queer comic but it has that vibe.

Sometimes when the comic arrives months later I am disappointed to read a perfectly compelling but alas no-queer story (I'm looking at you [This One Summer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18465566-this-one-summer)). This however was the complete opposite, it's so fucking queer and it's great. My absolute weakness in book buying is charming, friendly and queer comics.

### Our Colors (2022) _by Gengoroh Tagame_
[My Brother's Husband (2017)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32337897-my-brother-s-husband-volume-1) completely ruined me, which was the award-winning first-ever safe-for-work creation of Gengoroh Tagame.

So when I saw a new manga from him in the previews I immediately ordered it. This time around it doesn't have that same kind of guttural punch and isn't such an in-depth exploration of Japan's cultural attitudes to homosexuality.

However, it is very charming. Nothing too amazing, or too extreme happens it's just very lovely. The visual metaphors used throughout for being in the closet and pretending to be straight are as funny as they are saddening.

If you haven't read My Brother's Husband, pick that up first but if you have this is a lovely chilled-out follow-up.

## üí• Graphic Novels/Comics

### Superman (2016) _by Peter J Tomasi and Patrick Gleason_
This is the good shit. If you're curious to see what "making the big blue boy scout work for modern audiences" looks like, it's this run. I read the omnibus version, but you can read it on the DC app or pick up the trade paperbacks.

This sees classic superman enter a new phase of life, raising a sun and coming back out into the world after some time in hiding. 

It's got time-travelling dinosaurs, it's got Lex Luthor, it's got feel-good lines about truth and justice. 

What a vibe.

### Something Is Killing the Children (2020)
What if stranger things was darker, more people died and there was a secret society of monster hunters?

Oh also to join the society of monster hunters you trap the monster under your bed in a teddybear for threatening paranormal advice.

James Tynion IV is now one of those comics authors where I'll pick up pretty much anything he writes by default now.

### Batman (2013) by _Scott Snyder_

I've not really ever been a Batman person, but these two omnibuses made me into one. After only really consuming the Nolan-esque dark and gritty batman, this run sees a grumpy batman paired with his classic comic-book-ey elements.

There's a bat-blimp at one point, what more could you ask for?

### Fantastic Four (2010) _by Jonathan Hickman_
The above comic books are very much accessible enough for really anyone to pick up and enjoy, and I recommend you do! This however is layered in comic-book weirdness and continuity treats.

Jonathan Hickman wrote my favourite ever comic, East of West, and since I read that I've been delving back into his older Marvel back catalogue.

This run builds up to the mega-event Secret Wars and does a lot of the things only long-term serialized storytelling can do. There are payoffs set up here that only come to fruition deep into his Avengers run(which is also great).

Similar to Scott Snyder's Batman, this has made me into more of a Fantastic Four person whereas I never was before.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Biography

### This Much is True (2021) _by Miriam Margolyes_
Miriam Margolyes is a marmite kinda person, if you like her get the audiobook and you'll have a whale of a time.

## üí° Non Fiction

### Hiroshima (1946) _by John Hersey_
Because I'm stupid, my response to reading about risks of nuclear war in the news was to try and read as much as possible about it.

This is one of those books that has such visceral imagery and is so horrific on its own and then you remember it's non-fiction and your stomach turns.

I feel like it's an important book to read since most I've ever read about the nuclear bombs dropped on Japan were about the scientists who made them, the generals who ordered them to be dropped and the political fall-out after the fact.

This is about the people on the ground on the day, a few of them survivors and indeed the culture and communities that span out from those events.


### Sorry I‚Äôm Late I Didn‚Äôt Want To Come (2019) _by Jessica Pan_

This was pretty light and harmless, more biography than self-help. It was nice hearing about the author's journey to a better understanding of what she enjoyed and what she didn't.

I wouldn't necessarily recommend this book, but I don't not recommend it either.

### Stolen Focus (2022) _by Johann Hari_

Ironically I saw a plug for this while scrolling Twitter. It is a timely look at exactly why we feel we can't do any deep focus anymore with some good stories and anecdotes thrown in. 

It is a deeply realistic take on the state of the attention economy, and because of that a fairly depressing take. There is no solution here for the individual, this is a descriptive account of how bad things are written with lovely prose. 

Now for most people, I'd probably say it's not necessarily worth reading, but for those of us working in tech, I'd say it's essential. Books like this are key to making sure we understand the impact of the work we do.

### Lost Connections (2018) _by Johann Hari_
This is a book I'm conflicted about a great deal. On the one hand, I spent a lot of it nodding along to the author. Yes, our sense of community has diminished, meaningful connections are harder than ever to create and maintain, and we probably are over-prescribing medication for mental illness.

However, I dislike the effect this book can have sometimes. It can result in a wholesale dismissal of any and all medical interventions for mental health issues that could be a little dangerous.

Like a lot of things, the uncomfortable reality is a murky grey area. 

Ultimately a compelling read with a lot to chew over and I think worth reading even though I don't agree with a lot of stuff in there.

## ‚õîÔ∏è DNFs

This year I only had two books that I gave up reading part way through, both for completely different reasons.

### Effortless (2021) _by Greg McKeown_

Overly short, barely anything to say, regurgitating ideas from other people in shorter and less compelling ways. A complete waste of money and time.

For me to DNF a 7-hour-long self-help audio book is pretty rare for me, that's how bad it is.

### Black Leopard, Red Wolf (2019) _by Marlon James_

This was the complete opposite issue, I enjoyed this. The setting was compelling, and the queer elements of the characters and the language was so well put together. However, it was written in _such_ a clever style I wished it would get out of its own way and just let the characters and setting flourish. This is absolutely what happens when a [Booker Prize winner](https://thebookerprizes.com/the-booker-library/authors/marlon-james) writes a fantasy novel. For some people, that's a dream. However, for my fickle brain, it was just a bit too uphill to get finished.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Favourite Book of the Year

### Piranesi (2021) _by Susanna Clarke_
I am going to tell you absolutely nothing about this book because that's how I picked it up and I think it's the best way to go into it.

It's not very long, it's a wonderful little puzzle of a book. Also, the audiobook narrated by Chiwetel Ejiofor is sublime.
