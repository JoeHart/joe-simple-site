This was the first tech talk I did for the BBC while I was there. Talking about the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/branding/reith-font">BBC Reith</a> font project, which I had the pleasure of working on while I was there.

My domain was mostly around how are we going to distribute this font across the BBC's many many websites and many many tech stacks. As much a talk about organisational challenges as it is about technical ones.
