description: In February I gave a talk at JSWORLD Conference in Amsterdam. It was a bit of fun using a tool like react for something it shouldn't really be used for.

The first ever conference talk I gave, which was actually an adapated version of my <a href="https://threeweeksedinburgh.com/article/joe-hart-alpha-beta-gamer-total-comedy/">2017 Edinburgh Fringe Show</a> of the same name.

It's a fun interactive show looking at some classic video games. Also I alas owe a correction to this talk. The story about Gandhi and Civilisation is alas <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Gandhi#Urban_legend">completely false</a>, still very funny though.
