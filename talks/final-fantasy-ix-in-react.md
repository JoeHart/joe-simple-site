This is a sort of sequel to the talk I did at Frontend North earlier in the year. Looking at trying to recreate the classic PS1 fantasy RPG in React. It looks at how to use React Three Fiber to render 3d scenes and how to get a logic loop working. A semi sequel to my Age of Empires 2 in React talk.
